# Costumer Behaviour Predicton Using KNN  
This is simple project for introduction into unsupervised machine learning algorithms. 


We classify the costumers of a supermarket and dig deep for insights into their earning and spending behaviour using the data collected by the supermarket.  
We came to find that the codtumers there can be classified into 5 type using the KNN algorithm and the elbow method.
